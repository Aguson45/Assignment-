  1st assignment
 difference between Internet and world Wide Web services.

1. Creation and Hosting:

**Internet 
 The Internet encompasses various services beyond the WWW, including online gaming platforms, streaming services, cloud storage, and more.

**World wide web**
 These services are hosted on servers connected to the Internet but may not be part of the World wide web.


2. Security and Privacy: 

**Internet**
 The Internet infrastructure includes security protocols and mechanisms to protect data transmission and user privacy. However, 

**World wide web**
The WWW, being a subset of the Internet, also involves specific security measures such as HTTPS (HTTP Secure) for encrypted communication between web servers and clients.

3. Evolution and Innovation:

**Internet**
 Continuously evolves with advancements in technology, infrastructure, and services. While 

**World Wide Web**
has undergone significant evolution since its inception, it represents a specific subset of Internet services focused on accessing and sharing hypertext documents, with ongoing innovations in web development, standards, and protocols.


4. Interactivity and Communication :

**Internet**
 Enables a broader range of communication methods, such as VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol), video conferencing, online gaming, and real-time data exchange.While

 **World wide Web**
Facilitates interactive experiences through web applications, forums, social media platforms, and many more.


5. Regulation and Governance:

 **Internet**
 Operates under various regulatory frameworks established by governments and international organizations to ensure fair usage, privacy protection, cybersecurity, etc. mean while 

**World Wide Web**
 Being a significant component of the Internet, is subject to specific regulations and governance related to domain registration, content hosting, copyright, privacy laws, etc.



  2nd assignment
Difference between web1, web2, and web3 technology




1. User Interaction:
 @In Web 1.0, user interaction is limited to passive consumption of content.
 @Web 2.0 introduces active user participation, allowing users to generate content, share opinions, and engage with others.
 @Web 3.0 extends user interaction to decentralized networks, where users contribute, transact, and govern platforms and applications.

2. Semantic Understanding and Interoperability:
   
 @Web 1.0 and @Web 2.0 primarily focus on human-readable content, with limited machine understanding and interoperability.
 @Web 3.0 emphasizes the Semantic Web and data interoperability, enabling machines to understand and process information more intelligently, leading to enhanced automation and integration of services.


3. Centralization vs. Decentralization:

 @Web 1.0 and @Web 2.0 are characterized by centralized control, with content creation, hosting, and distribution managed by centralized entities.

 @Web 3.0 emphasizes decentralization, aiming to reduce reliance on intermediaries and promote peer-to-peer interactions through decentralized networks and protocols.

4. Data Handling and Privacy:
 
 @Web 1.0 and @Web 2.0 involve centralized data storage and management, raising concerns about privacy and data ownership.
 @Web 3.0 introduces decentralized data architectures, enhancing privacy, security, and user control over personal data through cryptographic techniques and decentralized identifiers.

5. Content Dynamics:
  @Web 1.0 features static, read-only content with minimal interactivity.
  @Web 2.0 introduces dynamic, user-generated content, fostering collaboration and social interaction.
  @Web 3.0 emphasizes decentralized, machine-understandable content and services, leveraging technologies like blockchain and the Semantic Web.
